From the morn to the evening he strays; He shall follow his sheep all the day, And his tongue shall be fillÃ¨d with praise. For he hears the lambsâ innocent call, And he hears the ewesâ tender reply; He is watchful while they are in peace, For they know when their shepherd is nigh.\n\n THE ECHOING GREEN  The sun does arise, And make happy the skies; The merry bells ring To welcome the Spring; The skylark and thrush, The birds of the bush, Sing louder around To the bellsâ cheerful sound; While our sports shall be seen On the echoing green. Old John, with white hair, Does laugh away care, Sitting under the oak, Among the old folk. They laugh at our play, And soon they all say, âSuch, such were the joys When we allâgirls and boysâ In our youth-time were seen On the echoing green.â Till the little ones, weary, No more can be merry: The sun does descend, And our sports have an end. Round the laps of their mothers Many sisters and brothers, Like birds in their nest, Are ready for rest, And sport no more seen On the darkening green.\n\n THE LAMB  Little lamb, who made thee? Does thou know who made thee, Gave thee life, and bid thee feed By the stream and oâer the mead; Gave thee clothing of delight, Softest clothing, woolly, bright; Gave thee such a tender voice, Making all the vales rejoice?     Little lamb, who made thee?     Does thou know who made thee? Little lamb, Iâll tell thee; Little lamb, Iâll tell thee: He is callÃ¨d by thy name, For He calls Himself a Lamb. He is meek, and He is mild, He became a little child. I a child, and thou a lamb, We are callÃ¨d by His name.     Little lamb, God bless thee!     Little lamb, God bless thee!\n\n THE LITTLE BLACK BOY  My mother bore me in the southern wild,     And I am black, but O my soul is white! White as an angel is the English child,     But I am black, as if bereaved of light. My mother taught me underneath a tree,     And, sitting down before the heat of day, She took me on her lap and kissÃ¨d me,     And, pointing to the East, began to say: âLook on the rising sun: there God does live,     And gives His light, and gives His heat away, And flowers and trees and beasts and men receive     Comfort in morning, joy in the noonday. âAnd we are put on earth a little space,     That we may learn to bear the beams of love; And these black bodies and this sunburnt face     Are but a cloud, and like a shady grove. âFor, when our souls have learned the heat to bear,     The cloud will vanish, we shall hear His voice, Saying, âCome out from the grove, my love and care,     And round my golden tent like lambs rejoice.ââ Thus did my mother say, and kissed me,     And thus I say to little English boy. When I from black, and he from white cloud free,     And round the tent of God like lambs we joy, Iâll shade him from the heat till he can bear     To lean in joy upon our Fatherâs knee; And then Iâll stand and stroke his silver hair,     And be like him, and he will then love me.\n\n THE BLOSSOM  Merry, merry sparrow! Under leaves so green     A happy blossom Sees you, swift as arrow, Seek your cradle narrow,     Near my bosom. Pretty, pretty robin! Under leaves so green     A happy blossom Hears you sobbing, sobbing, Pretty, pretty robin,     Near my bosom.\n\n THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER  When my mother died I was very young, And my father sold me while yet my tongue Could scarcely cry âWeep! weep! weep! weep!â So your chimneys I sweep, and in soot I sleep. Thereâs little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head, That curled like a lambâs back, was shaved; so I said, âHush, Tom! never mind it, for, when your headâs bare, You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.â And so he was quiet, and that very night, As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight!â That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, and Jack, Were all of them locked up in coffins of black. And by came an angel, who had a bright key, And he opened the coffins, and set them all free; Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing, they run And wash in a river, and shine in the sun. Then naked and white, all their bags left behind, They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind: And the angel told Tom, if heâd be a good boy, Heâd have God for his father, and never want joy. And so Tom awoke, and we rose in the dark, And got with our bags and our brushes to work. Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy and warm: So, if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.\n\n THE LITTLE BOY LOST  âFather, father, where are you going?     O do not walk so fast! Speak, father, speak to your little boy,     Or else I shall be lost.â The night was dark, no father was there,     The child was wet with dew; The mire was deep, and the child did weep,     And away the vapour flew.\n\n THE LITTLE BOY FOUND  The little boy lost in the lonely fen,     Led by the wandering light, Began to cry, but God, ever nigh,     Appeared like his father, in white. He kissed the child, and by the hand led,     And to his mother brought, Who in sorrow pale, through the lonely dale,     Her little boy weeping sought.\n\n LAUGHING SONG  When the green woods laugh with the voice of joy, And the dimpling stream runs laughing by; When the air does laugh with our merry wit, And the green hill laughs with the noise of it; When the meadows laugh with lively green, And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene; When Mary and Susan and Emily With their sweet round mouths sing âHa ha he!â When the painted birds laugh in the shade, Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread: Come live, and be merry, and join with me, To sing the sweet chorus of âHa ha he!â\n\n A CRADLE SONG  Sweet dreams, form a shade Oâer my lovely infantâs head! Sweet dreams of pleasant streams By happy, silent, moony beams! Sweet Sleep, with soft down Weave thy brows an infant crown! Sweet Sleep, angel mild, Hover oâer my happy child! Sweet smiles, in the night Hover over my delight! Sweet smiles, motherâs smiles, All the livelong night beguiles. Sweet moans, dovelike sighs, Chase not slumber from thy eyes! Sweet moans, sweeter smiles, All the dovelike moans beguiles. Sleep, sleep, happy child! All creation slept and smiled. Sleep, sleep, happy sleep, While oâer thee thy mother weep. Sweet babe, in thy face Holy image I can trace; Sweet babe, once like thee Thy Maker lay, and wept for me: Wept for me, for thee, for all, When He was an infant small. Thou His image ever see, Heavenly face that smiles on thee! Smiles on thee, on me, on all, Who became an infant small; Infant smiles are His own smiles; Heaven and earth to peace beguiles.\n\n THE DIVINE IMAGE  To Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,     All pray in their distress, And to these virtues of delight     Return their thankfulness. For Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,     Is God our Father dear; And Mercy, Pity, Peace, and Love,     Is man, His child and care. For Mercy has a human heart;     Pity, a human face; And Love, the human form divine:     And Peace the human dress. Then every man, of every clime,     That prays in his distress, Prays to the human form divine:     Love, Mercy, Pity, Peace. And all must love the human form,     In heathen, Turk, or Jew. Where Mercy, Love, and Pity dwell,     There God is dwelling too.\n\n HOLY THURSDAY  âTwas on a holy Thursday, their innocent faces clean, The children walking two and two, in red, and blue, and green: Grey-headed beadles walked before, with wands as white as snow, Till into the high dome of Paulâs they like Thames waters flow. O what a multitude they seemed, these flowers of London town! Seated in companies they sit, with radiance all their own. The hum of multitudes was there, but multitudes of lambs, Thousands of little boys and girls raising their innocent hands. Now like a mighty wind they raise to heaven the voice of song, Or like harmonious thunderings the seats of heaven among: Beneath them sit the aged men, wise guardians of the poor. Then cherish pity, lest you drive an angel from your door.\n\n NIGHT  The sun descending in the West, The evening star does shine; The birds are silent in their nest, And I must seek for mine. The moon, like a flower In heavenâs high bower, With silent delight, Sits and smiles on the night. Farewell, green fields and happy groves, Where flocks have took delight, Where lambs have nibbled, silent moves The feet of angels bright; Unseen, they pour blessing, And joy without ceasing, On each bud and blossom, And each sleeping bosom. They look in every thoughtless nest Where birds are covered warm; They visit caves of every beast, To keep them all from harm: If they see any weeping That should have been sleeping, They pour sleep on their head, And sit down by their bed. When wolves and tigers howl for prey, They pitying stand and weep; Seeking to drive their thirst away, And keep them from the sheep. But, if they rush dreadful, The angels, most heedful, Receive each mild spirit, New worlds to inherit. And there the lionâs ruddy eyes Shall flow with tears of gold: And pitying the tender cries, And walking round the fold: Saying: âWrath by His meekness, And, by His health, sickness, Is driven away From our immortal day. âAnd now beside thee, bleating lamb, I can lie down and sleep, Or think on Him who bore thy name, Graze after thee, and weep. For, washed in lifeâs river, My bright mane for ever Shall shine like the gold, As I guard oâer the fold.\n\n SPRING        Sound the flute!       Now itâs mute!       Birds delight,       Day and night,       Nightingale,       In the dale,       Lark in sky,â       Merrily, Merrily, merrily to welcome in the year.       Little boy,       Full of joy;       Little girl,       Sweet and small;       Cock does crow,       So do you;       Merry voice,       Infant noise; Merrily, merrily to welcome in the year.       Little lamb,       Here I am;       Come and lick       My white neck;       Let me pull       Your soft wool;       Let me kiss       Your soft face; Merrily, merrily we welcome in the year.\n\n NURSEâS SONG  When voices of children are heard on the green,     And laughing is heard on the hill, My heart is at rest within my breast,     And everything else is still. âThen come home, my children, the sun is gone down,     And the dews of night arise; Come, come, leave off play, and let us away,     Till the morning appears in the skies.â âNo, no, let us play, for it is yet day,     And we cannot go to sleep; Besides, in the sky the little birds fly,     And the hills are all covered with sheep.â âWell, well, go and play till the light fades away,     And then go home to bed.â The little ones leaped, and shouted, and laughed,     And all the hills echoÃ¨d.\n\n INFANT JOY  âI have no name; I am but two days old.â What shall I call thee? âI happy am, Joy is my name.â Sweet joy befall thee! Pretty joy! Sweet joy, but two days old. Sweet joy I call thee: Thou dost smile, I sing the while; Sweet joy befall thee!\n\n A DREAM  Once a dream did weave a shade Oâer my angel-guarded bed, That an emmet lost its way Where on grass methought I lay. Troubled, wildered, and forlorn, Dark, benighted, travel-worn, Over many a tangled spray, All heart-broke, I heard her say: âO my children! do they cry, Do they hear their father sigh? Now they look abroad to see, Now return and weep for me.â Pitying, I dropped a tear: But I saw a glow-worm near, Who replied, âWhat wailing wight Calls the watchman of the night?â âI am set to light the ground, While the beetle goes his round: Follow now the beetleâs hum; Little wanderer, hie thee home!â\n\n ON ANOTHERâS SORROW  Can I see anotherâs woe, And not be in sorrow too? Can I see anotherâs grief, And not seek for kind relief? Can I see a falling tear, And not feel my sorrowâs share? Can a father see his child Weep, nor be with sorrow filled? Can a mother sit and hear An infant groan, an infant fear? No, no! never can it be! Never, never can it be! And can He who smiles on all Hear the wren with sorrows small, Hear the small birdâs grief and care, Hear the woes that infants bearâ And not sit beside the nest, Pouring pity in their breast, And not sit the cradle near, Weeping tear on infantâs tear? And not sit both night and day, Wiping all our tears away? O no! never can it be! Never, never can it be! He doth give His joy to all: He becomes an infant small, He becomes a man of woe, He doth feel the sorrow too. Think not thou canst sigh a sigh, And thy Maker is not by: Think not thou canst weep a tear, And thy Maker is not near. O He gives to us His joy, That our grief He may destroy: Till our grief is fled and gone He doth sit by us and moan.\n\n SONGS OF EXPERIENCE\n\n INTRODUCTION      Hear the voice of the Bard, Who present, past, and future, sees;     Whose ears have heard     The Holy Word That walked among the ancient trees;     Calling the lapsÃ©d soul, And weeping in the evening dew;     That might control     The starry pole, And fallen, fallen light renew!     âO Earth, O Earth, return! Arise from out the dewy grass!     Night is worn,     And the morn Rises from the slumbrous mass.     âTurn away no more; Why wilt thou turn away?     The starry floor,     The watery shore, Is given thee till the break of day.â\n\n EARTHâS ANSWER      Earth raised up her head From the darkness dread and drear,         Her light fled,         Stony, dread, And her locks covered with grey despair.     âPrisoned on watery shore, Starry jealousy does keep my den         Cold and hoar;         Weeping oâer, I hear the father of the ancient men.     âSelfish father of men! Cruel, jealous, selfish fear!         Can delight,         Chained in night, The virgins of youth and morning bear.     âDoes spring hide its joy, When buds and blossoms grow?         Does the sower         Sow by night, Or the ploughman in darkness plough?     âBreak this heavy chain, That does freeze my bones around!         Selfish, vain,         Eternal bane, That free love with bondage bound.â\n\n THE CLOD AND THE PEBBLE  âLove seeketh not itself to please,     Nor for itself hath any care, But for another gives its ease,     And builds a heaven in hellâs despair.â So sung a little clod of clay,     Trodden with the cattleâs feet, But a pebble of the brook     Warbled out these metres meet: âLove seeketh only Self to please,     To bind another to its delight, Joys in anotherâs loss of ease,     And builds a hell in heavenâs despite.â\n\n HOLY THURSDAY  Is this a holy thing to see     In a rich and fruitful land,â Babes reduced to misery,     Fed with cold and usurous hand? Is that trembling cry a song?     Can it be a song of joy? And so many children poor?     It is a land of poverty! And their sun does never shine,     And their fields are bleak and bare, And their ways are filled with thorns,     It is eternal winter there. For whereâer the sun does shine,     And whereâer the rain does fall, Babe can never hunger there,     Nor poverty the mind appal.\n\n THE LITTLE GIRL LOST  In futurity I prophesy That the earth from sleep (Grave the sentence deep) Shall arise, and seek For her Maker meek; And the desert wild Become a garden mild. In the southern clime, Where the summerâs prime Never fades away, Lovely Lyca lay. Seven summers old Lovely Lyca told. She had wandered long, Hearing wild birdsâ song. âSweet sleep, come to me, Underneath this tree; Do father, mother, weep? Where can Lyca sleep? âLost in desert wild Is your little child. How can Lyca sleep If her mother weep? âIf her heart does ache, Then let Lyca wake; If my mother sleep, Lyca shall not weep. âFrowning, frowning night, Oâer this desert bright Let thy moon arise, While I close my eyes.â Sleeping Lyca lay, While the beasts of prey, Come from caverns deep, Viewed the maid asleep. The kingly lion stood, And the virgin viewed: Then he gambolled round Oâer the hallowed ground. Leopards, tigers, play Round her as she lay; While the lion old Bowed his mane of gold, And her bosom lick, And upon her neck, From his eyes of flame, Ruby tears there came; While the lioness Loosed her slender dress, And naked they conveyed To caves the sleeping maid.\n\n THE LITTLE GIRL FOUND  All the night in woe Lycaâs parents go Over valleys deep, While the deserts weep. Tired and woe-begone, Hoarse with making moan, Arm in arm, seven days They traced the desert ways. Seven nights they sleep Among shadows deep, And dream they see their child Starved in desert wild. Pale through pathless ways The fancied image strays, Famished, weeping, weak, With hollow piteous shriek. Rising from unrest, The trembling woman pressed With feet of weary woe; She could no further go. In his arms he bore Her, armed with sorrow sore; Till before their way A couching lion lay. Turning back was vain: Soon his heavy mane Bore them to the ground, Then he stalked around, Smelling to his prey; But their fears allay When he licks their hands, And silent by them stands. They look upon his eyes, Filled with deep surprise; And wondering behold A spirit armed in gold. On his head a crown, On his shoulders down Flowed his golden hair. Gone was all their care. âFollow me,â he said; âWeep not for the maid; In my palace deep, Lyca lies asleep.â Then they followÃ¨d Where the vision led, And saw their sleeping child Among tigers wild. To this day they dwell In a lonely dell, Nor fear the wolvish howl Nor the lionâs growl.\n\n THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER  A little black thing among the snow,     Crying! âweep! weep!â in notes of woe! âWhere are thy father and mother? Say!ââ     âThey are both gone up to the church to pray. âBecause I was happy upon the heath,     And smiled among the winterâs snow, They clothed me in the clothes of death,     And taught me to sing the notes of woe. âAnd because I am happy and dance and sing,     They think they have done me no injury, And are gone to praise God and His priest and king,     Who made up a heaven of our misery.â\n\n NURSEâS SONG  When the voices of children are heard on the green,     And whisperings are in the dale, The days of my youth rise fresh in my mind,     My face turns green and pale. Then come home, my children, the sun is gone down,     And the dews of night arise; Your spring and your day are wasted in play,     And your winter and night in disguise.\n\n THE SICK ROSE  O rose, thou art sick!     The invisible worm, That flies in the night,     In the howling storm, Has found out thy bed     Of crimson joy, And his dark secret love     Does thy life destroy.\n\n THE FLY  Little Fly,     Thy summerâs play My thoughtless hand     Has brushed away. Am not I     A fly like thee? Or art not thou     A man like me? For I dance,     And drink, and sing, Till some blind hand     Shall brush my wing. If thought is life     And strength and breath, And the want     Of thought is death; Then am I     A happy fly. If I live,     Or if I die.\n\n THE ANGEL  I dreamt a dream!  What can it mean? And that I was a maiden Queen Guarded by an Angel mild: Witless woe was neâer beguiled! And I wept both night and day, And he wiped my tears away; And I wept both day and night, And hid from him my heartâs delight. So he took his wings, and fled; Then the morn blushed rosy red. I dried my tears, and armed my fears With ten thousand shields and spears. Soon my Angel came again; I was armed, he came in vain; For the time of youth was fled, And grey hairs were on my head.\n\n THE TIGER  Tiger, tiger, burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry? In what distant deeps or skies Burnt the fire of thine eyes? On what wings dare he aspire? What the hand dare seize the fire? And what shoulder and what art Could twist the sinews of thy heart? And, when thy heart began to beat, What dread hand and what dread feet? What the hammer? what the chain? In what furnace was thy brain? What the anvil? what dread grasp Dare its deadly terrors clasp? When the stars threw down their spears, And watered heaven with their tears, Did He smile His work to see? Did He who made the lamb make thee? Tiger, tiger, burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?\n\n MY PRETTY ROSE TREE  A flower was offered to me,     Such a flower as May never bore; But I said, âIâve a pretty rose tree,â     And I passed the sweet flower oâer. Then I went to my pretty rose tree,     To tend her by day and by night; But my rose turned away with jealousy,     And her thorns were my only delight.\n\n AH, SUNFLOWER  Ah, sunflower, weary of time,     Who countest the steps of the sun; Seeking after that sweet golden clime     Where the travellerâs journey is done; Where the Youth pined away with desire,     And the pale virgin shrouded in snow, Arise from their graves, and aspire     Where my Sunflower wishes to go!\n\n THE LILY  The modest Rose puts forth a thorn, The humble sheep a threatâning horn: While the Lily white shall in love delight, Nor a thorn nor a threat stain her beauty bright.\n\n THE GARDEN OF LOVE  I went to the Garden of Love,     And saw what I never had seen; A Chapel was built in the midst,     Where I used to play on the green. And the gates of this Chapel were shut,     And âThou shalt notâ writ over the door; So I turned to the Garden of Love     That so many sweet flowers bore. And I saw it was filled with graves,     And tombstones where flowers should be; And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds,     And binding with briars my joys and desires.\n\n THE LITTLE VAGABOND  Dear mother, dear mother, the Church is cold; But the Alehouse is healthy, and pleasant, and warm. Besides, I can tell where I am used well; Such usage in heaven will never do well. But, if at the Church they would give us some ale, And a pleasant fire our souls to regale, Weâd sing and weâd pray all the livelong day, Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray. Then the Parson might preach, and drink, and sing, And weâd be as happy as birds in the spring; And modest Dame Lurch, who is always at church, Would not have bandy children, nor fasting, nor birch. And God, like a father, rejoicing to see His children as pleasant and happy as He, Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the barrel, But kiss him, and give him both drink and apparel.\n\n LONDON  I wander through each chartered street,     Near where the chartered Thames does flow, A mark in every face I meet,     Marks of weakness, marks of woe. In every cry of every man,     In every infantâs cry of fear, In every voice, in every ban,     The mind-forged manacles I hear: How the chimney-sweeperâs cry     Every blackening church appals, And the hapless soldierâs sigh     Runs in blood down palace-walls. But most, through midnight streets I hear     How the youthful harlotâs curse Blasts the new-born infantâs tear,     And blights with plagues the marriage hearse.\n\n THE HUMAN ABSTRACT  Pity would be no more If we did not make somebody poor, And Mercy no more could be If all were as happy as we. And mutual fear brings Peace, Till the selfish loves increase; Then Cruelty knits a snare, And spreads his baits with care. He sits down with holy fears, And waters the ground with tears; Then Humility takes its root Underneath his foot. Soon spreads the dismal shade Of Mystery over his head, And the caterpillar and fly Feed on the Mystery. And it bears the fruit of Deceit, Ruddy and sweet to eat, And the raven his nest has made In its thickest shade. The gods of the earth and sea Sought through nature to find this tree, But their search was all in vain: There grows one in the human Brain.\n\n INFANT SORROW  My mother groaned, my father wept: Into the dangerous world I leapt, Helpless, naked, piping loud, Like a fiend hid in a cloud. Struggling in my fatherâs hands, Striving against my swaddling bands, Bound and weary, I thought best To sulk upon my motherâs breast.\n\n A POISON TREE  I was angry with my friend: I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my foe: I told it not, my wrath did grow. And I watered it in fears Night and morning with my tears, And I sunnÃ¨d it with smiles And with soft deceitful wiles. And it grew both day and night, Till it bore an apple bright, And my foe beheld it shine, And he knew that it was mine,â And into my garden stole When the night had veiled the pole; In the morning, glad, I see My foe outstretched beneath the tree.\n\n A LITTLE BOY LOST  âNought loves another as itself,     Nor venerates another so, Nor is it possible to thought     A greater than itself to know. âAnd, father, how can I love you     Or any of my brothers more? I love you like the little bird     That picks up crumbs around the door.â The Priest sat by and heard the child;     In trembling zeal he seized his hair, He led him by his little coat,     And all admired his priestly care. And standing on the altar high,     âLo, what a fiend is here!â said he: âOne who sets reason up for judge     Of our most holy mystery.â The weeping child could not be heard,     The weeping parents wept in vain: They stripped him to his little shirt,     And bound him in an iron chain, And burned him in a holy place     Where many had been burned before; The weeping parents wept in vain.     Are such things done on Albionâs shore?\n\n A LITTLE GIRL LOST  Children of the future age, Reading this indignant page, Know that in a former time Love, sweet love, was thought a crime. In the age of gold, Free from winterâs cold, Youth and maiden bright, To the holy light, Naked in the sunny beams delight. Once a youthful pair, Filled with softest care, Met in garden bright Where the holy light Had just removed the curtains of the night. There, in rising day, On the grass they play; Parents were afar, Strangers came not near, And the maiden soon forgot her fear. Tired with kisses sweet, They agree to meet When the silent sleep Waves oâer heavenâs deep, And the weary tired wanderers weep. To her father white Came the maiden bright; But his loving look, Like the holy book, All her tender limbs with terror shook. Ona, pale and weak, To thy father speak! O the trembling fear! O the dismal care That shakes the blossoms of my hoary hair!â\n\n A DIVINE IMAGE  Cruelty has a human heart,     And Jealousy a human face; Terror the human form divine,     And Secrecy the human dress. The human dress is forgÃ¨d iron,     The human form a fiery forge, The human face a furnace sealed,     The human heart its hungry gorge.\n\n A CRADLE SONG  Sleep, sleep, beauty bright, Dreaming in the joys of night; Sleep, sleep; in thy sleep Little sorrows sit and weep. Sweet babe, in thy face Soft desires I can trace, Secret joys and secret smiles, Little pretty infant wiles. As thy softest limbs I feel, Smiles as of the morning steal Oâer thy cheek, and oâer thy breast Where thy little heart doth rest. O the cunning wiles that creep In thy little heart asleep! When thy little heart doth wake, Then the dreadful light shall break.\n\n TO TIRZAH  Whateâer is born of mortal birth Must be consumÃ¨d with the earth, To rise from generation free: Then what have I to do with thee? The sexes sprung from shame and pride, Blowed in the morn, in evening died; But mercy changed death into sleep; The sexes rose to work and weep. Thou, mother of my mortal part, With cruelty didst mould my heart, And with false self-deceiving tears Didst blind my nostrils, eyes, and ears, Didst close my tongue in senseless clay, And me to mortal life betray. The death of Jesus set me free: Then what have I to do with thee?\n\n THE SCHOOLBOY  I love to rise in a summer morn,     When the birds sing on every tree; The distant huntsman winds his horn,     And the skylark sings with me:     O what sweet company! But to go to school in a summer morn,â     O it drives all joy away! Under a cruel eye outworn,     The little ones spend the day     In sighing and dismay. Ah then at times I drooping sit,     And spend many an anxious hour; Nor in my book can I take delight,     Nor sit in learningâs bower,     Worn through with the dreary shower. How can the bird that is born for joy     Sit in a cage and sing? How can a child, when fears annoy,     But droop his tender wing,     And forget his youthful spring! O father and mother if buds are nipped,     And blossoms blown away; And if the tender plants are stripped     Of their joy in the springing day,     By sorrow and careâs dismay,â How shall the summer arise in joy,     Or the summer fruits appear? Or how shall we gather what griefs destroy,     Or bless the mellowing year,     When the blasts of winter appear?\n\n THE VOICE OF THE ANCIENT BARD  Youth of delight! come hither And see the opening morn, Image of Truth new-born. Doubt is fled, and clouds of reason, Dark disputes and artful teazing. Folly is an endless maze; Tangled roots perplex her ways; How many have fallen there! They stumble all night over bones of the dead; And feelâthey know not what but care; And wish to lead others, when they should be led.",

            "text":"Two contrary states of the human soul The moon like a flower,In Heavens high bower;With silent delight,Sits and smiles on the night.(Night)At times the weight of the reputation of an artist is that intimidating I can barely overcome trepidation to venture into approaching his or her work. William Blake is such an artist. So when this lovely little book arrived in the letter box as a birthday present, it felt like a sweet little heartening push, giving me the courage to dive into the refreshing water of the unknown, holding the promise of a thrilling encounter with the imagination of supreme mind. Unsure what to expect and what those two parts – innocence and experience – would stand for, making Blake’s acquaintance was a highly rewarding reading experience I cannot really compare to any other I had before. From innocence, which seems mostly the one of childhood, symbolised by scenes on infants, children, a shepherd, mothers in a pastoral setting, the transition to experience is evocated by a darkening mood and tone, in which consciousness rises of the adult world in which danger, menace , anxiety undeniably will encumber happiness and joy and where comfort is hard to find – for adults nor for children. The powerful imagery is replete with fauna and flora, happiness and joy take the shape of a sparrow, a lamb, a robin, a grasshopper, a rose, spring, green fields, sweet sleep. Revolving to experience, a child is hungry, sweet flowers in the Garden of Love have changed into graves and tombstones, youthfulness dissolves, the narrative voice bemoans the multitudinous forms of human woe and suffering in London (‘The mind-forg’d manacles I hear’). A rose is tainted at the core. A mighty tiger roars, reminding of the mysterium tremendum et fascinans characterizing the religious experience of transcendence. At the first read I was particularly enthralled by the compelling, sublime musicality of the rhymes and the dynamics of the verses (it is thought that Blake set several of the verses to his own tunes, no scores have survived however). These are poems one can imagine a joy to learn and know by heart. In a second read, now having read the illuminating introduction which gives insight into the patterns of ‘contrary’ or answering poems in both parts of the book and the contrasts existing within the poems themselves, pointing at the the puzzling ambiguities, the contrary energies flowing through the poems, the angle of the brilliant mirroring interconnectivity of the composition was a delightful one, and I can easily imagine a third read will unveil other aspects. The beauteous edition I read draws on the version sold by his wife Catherine Boucher to the Bishop of Limerick in 1830 which ended up into the hands of E.M. Forster, offering it to King’s College, Cambridge – on the left page a literal transcription of each poem is printed, on the right page a reproduction of the original illustrated plate (the designs are not just for embellishment of the poems but intrinsically part of Blake’s poetic imagination). Absorbing the combination of both the words and the quaint images of Blake’s ‘illuminated printing’ at the same time proved ineffectual for me at the first read, so this gem volunteered as a new nightstand companion. At the moment it might be mostly obscure to me, but perhaps the more complex and mysterious meanings of the verses will further show upon rereading and exploring Blake more in depth. Youth of delight! come hitherAnd see the opening morn,Image of Truth new-born.Doubt is fled, and clouds of reason,Dark disputes and artful teazing.Folly is an endless maze;Tangled roots perplex her ways;How many have fallen there!They stumble all night over bones of the dead;And feel—they know not what but care;And wish to lead others, when they should be led.(The Voice of the Ancient Bard)",

            "text":"\n“Am not IA fly like thee?Or art not thouA man like me?” \nOut of all the poetry I have read, these four lines are amongst my favourite. They have stuck with me over several years and seem to resonate within me. I’ve even considered having them tattooed onto my arm. Why these lines? You may ask.It’s simple really: they say so much. Different readings can be made here, but the one I see most strongly is man talking to nature. Man questions it; he asks if he is the same as nature and if nature is the same as him. Is not the fly equal to him? Is not the fly’s life just as valuable as his own? All life is precious, and what I read here is a man coming to the realisation that this is so. Nature is valuable, and no matter how high man may place himself all life remains the same; it is the same force: the same energy. It could also be a bourgeoisie facing a member of the lower class and realising the same thing, but I prefer to stick with the human to animal relationship. Nature is huge, the ecosystem is huge. And, again, no matter how high man may place himself he is still just another cog on an ever turning mechanism. In the modern world he has damaged the system, the environment, but he is still part of a greater whole. And his part is no more important than that of the rest of the cogs. What I read in Blake’s words is an ideal, a projection of a semi-paradise; one man can perhaps reach if when he has gained experience he remembers where he came from: his innocence. Blake’s poetry is marvellously deceptive; it appears so simple, but that’s the beauty of it. Hidden behind the seemingly innocent childlike songs is a sense of irony, sarcasm and genius. The speakers of the poems describe the world as they see it; it is a mere reflection of their own limited perceptions; they see the world through a childlike and predetermined state. In essence, they see what they are meant to see, and nothing beyond that. Well, not until they gain experience and look back on their own folly. Even at this stage, Blake portrays the duality of the human soul; the two states coexist and inform each other. From this collection of poetry I’m left with the impression that these two stages are necessary for human development, but not exclusively so; it’s like Blake is suggesting that one should be able to see the world as an aspect of both. Throughout the poetry Blake also questions the meaning of standard religion and proposes his own ideas of a more natural approach to divinity. He believed that the gods existed within the bosom of man, and not in an exogenous limited interpretation. In this, he is a true Romantic poet. The more poetry I read in this age, the more I come to appreciate this idea. Blake’s poetry stands out amongst the crowd though. He used a completely unique style to get his the two states of the human soul across to the reader. But, again, he reflects the movement; his poems have a heavy emphasis on the freedom of self-expression and can only really be appreciated in conjunction with the plates he engraved them on. He was a true artist: \"Tyger Tyger, burning bright, In the forests of the night; What immortal hand or eye, Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\" Indeed, for me, the comparison between the “Lamb” and the “Tyger” cannot be appreciated without looking at the images. The two poems are not simply about different animal types. They are about good and evil; they are a comparison of the badness and benevolence of humankind. The lamb represents the most profound sense of inexperience; it is innocence and pure: it is docile and vulnerable in its infancy. In this it is comparable to the Christian saviour: it is the best degree of humanity. The Tyger, on the other hand, has a corrupt heart. He represents the negative aspects of humankind, and can be interpreted as part of industrialisation, commerce and power. Through this comparison the narrator of the poems questions how a creator could forge two opposing states. What is the purpose of such a thing? When the experience section has been read, it is vital to go back and look at innocence. It changes the nature of the poems, as the implicit becomes explicit. The layers of meaning are multiple and complex. I could spend a day pondering over some of them, but for me the most memorable one is “the fly” for the reasons I discussed: it will always stay with me.",

Tyger! burning bright, In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye Could frame thy fearful symmetry?I don’t think I would dare give any collection of poems that contains the above lines anything less than five stars. Luckily, although every poem isn’t a winner for me (cough*Laughing Song*cough), there are so many immortal poems in this collection that I don’t feel the least bit guilty for giving the collection the full five stars. I started collecting some of my favorite lines to put in this review (not even the whole poem in many cases), and when I got to three pages in Word I realized I would have to restrain myself from posting half the collection in this review. This review is still going to be on the long side, but you’ll have to just deal. :)William Blake, one of the most well-known authors of the Romantic era, published this short collection of poems or songs in the late 1700s. The full title was “Songs of Innocence and of Experience Showing the Two Contrary States of the Human Soul,” which aptly describes the dichotomy echoed in most of these poems, with innocent Christian belief and pastoral joy in the foreground in the nineteen Songs of Innocence, and dark cynicism, criticism of man’s institutions (including churches), and even despair playing a more prominent role in the twenty-seven Songs of Experience. In fact, many of the poems in the Innocence set have their darker counterpart in the Experience set. So you go from “The Lamb”:Little Lamb, who made thee? Dost thou know who made thee? Little Lamb, I'll tell thee, Little Lamb, I'll tell thee, He is called by thy name, For he calls himself a Lamb. He is meek, & he is mild; He became a little child. I a child, & thou a lamb, We are called by his name.to “The Tyger”:When the stars threw down their spears, And water'd heaven with their tears, Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the Lamb make thee?Even in the more lighthearted Songs of Innocence, more often than not there’s a dark undercurrent, a hint (or sometimes a slap across the face) that the narrator of the poem is being unintentionally ironic:\"The Little Black Boy\"My mother bore me in the southern wild, And I am black, but O! my soul is white; White as an angel is the English child, But I am black, as if bereav'd of light. … And thus I say to little English boy: When I from black and he from white cloud free, And round the tent of God like lambs we joy, I'll shade him from the heat, till he can bear To lean in joy upon our father's knee; And then I'll stand and stroke his silver hair, And be like him, and he will then love me.That last line is a heartbreaker. Even though the black boy sees that the white child is equally under a cloud, he still can’t imagine being accepted by him until he looks like him.Similarly, we have “The Chimney Sweeper,” where the young boys sold by their destitute families to be chimney sweepers’ assistants ― a terrible, cold, dirty job ― aptly cry “weep” in their childish lisps instead of \"sweep\":When my mother died I was very young, And my father sold me while yet my tongue Could scarcely cry \" 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!\" So your chimneys I sweep, & in soot I sleep. There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head, That curl'd like a lamb's back, was shav'd: so I said \"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when you head's bare You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.\"And so he was quiet, & that very night, As Tom was a-sleeping, he had such a sight! That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, & Jack, Were all of them lock'd up in coffins of black. And by came an Angel who had a bright key, And he open'd the coffins & set them free; Then down a green plain leaping, laughing, they run, And wash in a river, and shine in the Sun. Then naked & white, all their bags left behind, They rise upon clouds and sport in the wind; And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy, He'd have God for his father, & never want joy. And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark, And got with our bags & our brushes to work, Tho the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm, So if all do their duty they need not fear harm.Such an indictment of those who mistreat children and the less fortunate among us!This next one has stuck with my since I studied it in college. Even if you have Christian beliefs (as I do), you have to admit that the institutions of churches have often been misused by those in power. The last lines are haunting: “The Garden of Love”I went to the Garden of Love, And saw what I never had seen: A Chapel was built in the midst, Where I used to play on the green. And the gates of this Chapel were shut, And “Thou shalt not” writ over the door; So I turn'd to the Garden of Love That so many sweet flowers bore; And I saw it was filled with graves, And tomb-stones where flowers should be; And Priests in black gowns were walking their rounds, And binding with briars my joys & desires. Notice how the meter and rhyme change in those last two lines ― there’s something inexorable about it.A few more: I appreciate the insight into the effects of anger and grudges offered by “A Poison Tree”:I was angry with my friend: I told my wrath, my wrath did end. I was angry with my foe: I told it not, my wrath did grow. And I water'd it in fears, Night & morning with my tears; And I sunned it with smiles, And with soft deceitful wiles. And it grew both day and night, Till it bore an apple bright; And my foe beheld it shine, And he knew that it was mine, And into my garden stole When the night had veil'd the pole: In the morning glad I see My foe outstretch'd beneath the tree.And the stultifying strictures and chains of society get a knock in “London”:I wander thro' each charter'd street, Near where the charter'd Thames does flow, And mark in every face I meet Marks of weakness, marks of woe. In every cry of every Man, In every Infant's cry of fear, In every voice, in every ban, The mind-forg'd manacles I hear.I’ll go back to the Songs of Innocence to end on a more hopeful note: “On Another's Sorrow”Can I see another's woe, And not be in sorrow too? Can I see another's grief, And not seek for kind relief? Can I see a falling tear, And not feel my sorrow's share? Can a father see his child Weep, nor be with sorrow fill'd? … He doth give his joy to all; He becomes an infant small; He becomes a man of woe; He doth feel the sorrow too. Think not thou canst sigh a sigh And thy maker is not by; Think not thou canst weep a tear And thy maker is not near. O! he gives to us his joy That our grief he may destroy; Till our grief is fled & gone He doth sit by us and moan.I highly recommend this collection, and you can find copies of it free all over the web.A couple of notes on bonus material: When this book was originally published, each poem was handwritten by Blake on a separate page with an original painting that he did to go with that poem. For example:They're worth looking up, and often add to understanding of the meaning or intent of the poem.Also, many of these \"Songs of Innocence and of Experience\" actually were songs: at least some of them were set to music. As far as I'm aware none of the original tunes used by Blake have survived, but different people since have tried their hand at setting some of them to music, with varying results. Wikipedia links several of these modern song versions of the poems. I haven't checked them out yet, but if I find any good ones I'll link them here.2016 Classic Bingo Challenge: 5 down, 19 to go.",

Such an idyllic setting is an invitation to contemplate your own soul. For me, the countryside is where anything can happen. I feel hopeful. I find rest. I make time stand still; I see bliss. And I accept the countryside's cruelty on a dark, rainy day. That is the inevitable dichotomy of any form of life.Innocence. To see the world through the eyes of a child. Something so necessary, and so distant. Something that we lose too soon, now.Simply too soon.Laughing SongWhen the green woods laugh with the voice of joy,And the dimpling stream runs laughing by;When the air does laugh with our merry wit,And the green hill laughs with the noise of it;When the meadows laugh with lively green,And the grasshopper laughs in the merry scene;When Mary and Susan and EmilyWith their sweet round mouths sing 'Ha ha he!'When the painted birds laugh in the shade,Where our table with cherries and nuts is spread:Come live, and be merry, and join with me,To sing the sweet chorus of 'Ha ha he!' (10)NightThe sun descending in the West,The evening star does shine;The birds are silent in their nest,And I must seek for mine.The moon, like a flowerIn heaven's high bower,With silent delight,Sits and smiles on the night.Farewell, green fields and happy groves,Where flocks have took delight,Where lambs have nibbled, silent movesThe feet of angels bright;Unseen, they pour blessing,And joy without ceasing,On each bud and blossom,And each sleeping bosom... (14)Different perspectives. The pain of adulthood. The fight between love and selfishness. The corruption of innocence and our salvation. Our preservation: the world will not eat us alive—apparently. The fear of what is to come. Of the unknown. The gray despair of aging. These are some of the images of Blake's Experience. The Clod and the Pebble'Love seeketh not itself to please,Nor for itself hath any care,But for another gives its ease,And builds a heaven in hell's despair.'So sung a little clod of clay,Trodden with the cattle's feet,But a pebble of the brookWarbled out these metres meet:'Love seeketh only Self to please,To bind another to its delight,Joys in another's loss of ease,And builds a hell in heaven's despite.' (23)Ah, sunflowerAh, sunflower, weary of time,Who countest the steps of the sun;Seeking after that sweet golden climeWhere the traveller's journey is done;Where the Youth pined away with desire,And the pale virgin shrouded in snow,Arise from their graves, and aspireWhere my Sunflower wishes to go! (36)LondonI wander through each chartered street,Near where the chartered Thames does flow,A mark in every face I meet,Marks of weakness, marks of woe.In every cry of every man,In every infant's cry of fear,In every voice, in every ban,The mind-forged manacles I hear:How the chimney-sweeper's cryEvery blackening church appals,And the hapless soldier's sighRuns in blood down palace-walls.But most, through midnight streets I hearHow the youthful harlot's curseBlasts the new-born infant's tear,And blights with plagues the marriage hearse. (40)The lyrical voice of this fine poet stands out for its apparent simplicity. Blake knew his surroundings too well. He was aware of the social and political situation of his time as well as the spiritual concerns of human beings. And he transferred them to his pages to make them immortal. His sensitive and evocative poetry can conquer the most anxious soul and give it an ideal place to rest for a while.Jul 30, 14* Also on my blog.",

            "text":"So I have read this book a few times over just this past week alone, chipping away and picking up different parts at different times. Something that has been bothering me is how I am going to synthesize and consolidate my thoughts on a work such as this – and I think I finally have the answer. No pressure to rate something a certain number of stars. Simple it may be, but it took me so long to figure out. So my goal is to just scribble something down and continually come back to my notes as I continue to revisit the work. One doesn’t ever stop reading a work like this, and that goes with lots of poetry. Imagine reading The Sick Rose and then never touching it again for as long as you are alive. Cool. You read 8 short lines in under 30 seconds and achieved… what, exactly? I can’t really put into words what these poems are doing to me, and I don’t necessarily think that I have to. Maybe future readings, further synthesis, and more complex thought, buttressed by some more opinions (academic or not) may change my mind and allow me to act with enough conviction to rate some works of poetry definitively. For now, I am going to enjoy the ride. So with that, here are my basic “notes” to myself.Emotionally poignant poems in this work:-\tThe Shepherd (Innocence)-\tThe Little Black Boy (Innocence)-\tThe Chimney Sweeper (Innocence)-\tThe Little Boy Lost (Innocence)-\tThe Little Boy Found (Innocence)-\tThe Divine Image (Innocence)-\tOn Another’s Sorrow (Innocence)-\tThe Little Girl Lost (Experience)-\tThe Little Girl Found (Experience)-\tThe Chimney Sweeper (Experience)-\tLondon (Experience)-\tThe Human Abstract (Experience)-\tA Divine Image (Experience)Need to try to pick up on the vague connections apparent between the loose links of the two sections.",

            "text":"William Blake’s remarkably written and illustrated poems have endured the test of time and continue to amaze and delight me, even though I have read them dozens of times over the years. My favorite poems from the Songs of Innocence are, sadly, about innocence abused. It seems such a contrast to me to read Nurse’s Song, in which the children beg for more time to play and frolic in the open air and the “laughing is heard on the hill”, and the Chimney Sweeper, which opens with the death of a mother and selling of a child to work in the soot and suffocation of the chimney sweep. That the sweeper is able to maintain his innocence and trust in the face of such a fate is a remarkable testament to the faith of the yet unspoiled child.Of course, there are religious implications in each of the poems, which are intended and profound. The symbol of the lamb, as standing for both the children and their saviour, runs through several of the poems, including the most famous, The Lamb, which begins, familiarly, “Little lamb who made thee?”These poems would be quite impressive had Blake written only of innocence, but he wrote a second set of poems, Songs of Experience, which contrast diametrically with the innocence poems. In fact, many of them bear the same name, as in the poems titled Holy Thursday. The poem from Songs of Innocence portrays the children, lined up in twos, entering the cathedral with angelic faces and voices, close to heaven. It’s counterpart in Songs of Experience speaks of the poverty and hunger suffered by so many children of the time. Parallels exist between many of the poems, contrasting innocence and experience. As The Lamb is the most famous of the Innocence poems, The Tiger is the most famous of the Experience poems. The poems represent the natural world and God’s creation of both the predator and the prey. Blake’s exploration of the two aspects of God and the complexity of His creation.Cannot close without including my favorite of all the poems:A POISON TREEI was angry with my friend:I told my wrath, my wrath did end.I was angry with my foe:I told it not, my wrath did grow.And I watered it in fearsNight and morning with my tears,And I sunnèd it with smilesAnd with soft deceitful wiles.And it grew both day and night,Till it bore an apple bright,And my foe beheld it shine,And he knew that it was mine,—And into my garden stoleWhen the night had veiled the pole;In the morning, glad, I seeMy foe outstretched beneath the tree.",
